# ttools-global

Barebone repository to use the tools menu globally by typing `tt` into your terminal.

## Installation

Clone this repo, and run the installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/titledk/ttools-global.git
cd ttools-global;
./install/install.sh
```

This creates a default config for you that you can fill in with the scripts
you want to run. It's located in `ttools/config.yml`.

**NOTE** that the `ttools/config.yml` file is ignored from version control so that is's easy to
keep this library up-to-date while maintaining your own configuration.
